# Probabilistic Decision-Making Framework

### 🎯 The Goal
As a doctor transitioning into technology, my primary focus is on systems thinking and clear decision-making under uncertainty. I built this project to move beyond theory and create a functional model to assess probabilistic tradeoffs, helping me to understand optimization through direct visualization.

### 📜 Project Description
This repository contains `decisiontree.py`,`decisiontree_3dplot.py` a Python script that builds a 3D decision model. It is designed to analyze a scenario (like recruitment) by modeling Expected Monetary Values (EMVs) and mapping out all branch conditions and their potential outcomes.

### 💡 Key Concepts Solidified
* **Decision Theory:** Applying formal models to complex, real-world tradeoffs.
* **Optimization:** Visually identifying the most optimal path in a decision tree.
* **Probabilistic Modeling:** Translating uncertainty into a quantitative Python model.
* **Data Visualization:** Gaining insights not just from numbers, but from the structure of the model itself.

##  Upcoming Additions
- Case modeling from simulation chapters: portfolio optimization, restaurant queue simulation
- Data-driven simulation of patient flow in a hospital or demand clustering for diagnostics
- Linking with `gasmixer.py` style simulations for utility under resource constraints

##  Reflections
This is a powerful intersection of logic, probability, and impact. It helps me think about startups, medical operations, and infrastructure from a systems optimization perspective. I plan to combine this with thermodynamics and biology later.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- ChatGPT for feedback and debugging

##  Future Goals
- Introduce randomness and confidence intervals to decisions
- Use Monte Carlo simulations
- Explore optimization libraries later for higher complexity cases
