# Data, Models, and Decisions (MIT Sloan Inspired)

This repository contains my learning journey and code experiments based on the foundational topics covered in MIT Sloan's "Data, Models, and Decisions" course. It includes decision tree modeling, probability-based reasoning, and simulations for business and operational decisions.

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Building decision trees and calculating Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
- Exploring probabilistic decision-making
- Creating simulation models based on case studies (e.g., fisheries, portfolio optimization)

## 📂 Contents
### 1. `decisiontree.py`
A simple custom-built decision tree model from scratch using dictionaries to simulate decision branches, outcomes, and expected value calculations.

**Features:**
- Node-based branching with EMV calculation
- Modular structure for dynamic input

**Learning Outcome:**
Helped solidify the link between structured logic and data-driven choices. Next step: connect with uncertainty simulations.

### 2. `decisiontree_3dplot.py`
Attempt to visualize the decision tree in 3D using matplotlib. Took 2 hours to debug and understand.

**Learning Outcome:**
Visual complexity helped refine intuition about decision surfaces and nested contingencies.

## 🔭 Upcoming Additions
- Case modeling from simulation chapters: portfolio optimization, restaurant queue simulation
- Data-driven simulation of patient flow in a hospital or demand clustering for diagnostics
- Linking with `gasmixer.py` style simulations for utility under resource constraints

## 🌱 Reflections
This is a powerful intersection of logic, probability, and impact. It helps me think about startups, medical operations, and infrastructure from a systems optimization perspective. I plan to combine this with thermodynamics and biology later.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- ChatGPT for feedback and debugging

## ⚡ Future Goals
- Introduce randomness and confidence intervals to decisions
- Use Monte Carlo simulations
- Explore optimization libraries later for higher complexity cases
